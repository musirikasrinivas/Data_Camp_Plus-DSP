As Dhavide demonstrated, if you don't pass a name to the values in `` pd.melt() ``, you will lose the name of your variable. You can fix this by using the `` value_name `` keyword argument. \n",

    "In this exercise, you'll use two data sets from [Gapminder.org](http://gapminder.org) to investigatethe average life expectancy (in years) at birth in 2010 for the 6 continental regions. To do thisyou'll read the life expectancy data per country into one pandas DataFrame and the associationbetween country and region into another. \n",
    "By setting the index of both DataFrames to the country name,you'll then use the region information to group the countries in the life expectancy DataFrame andcompute the mean value for 2010.\n",

    "### Exercise(10) - Detecting outliers with Z-Scores\n",
    "As Dhavide demonstrated in the video using the `` zscore `` function, you can apply a `` .transform() `` method after grouping to apply a function to groups of data independently. The z-score is also useful to find outliers: a z-score value of +/- 3 is generally considered to be an outlier.\n",
    "In this example, you're going to normalize the Gapminder data in 2010 for life expectancy and fertility by the_z-score per region_. Using boolean indexing, you will filter out countries that have high fertility rates andlow life expectancy for their region.\n",
    "The Gapminder DataFrame for 2010 indexed by `` 'Country' `` is provided for you as `` gapminder_2010 ``.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Import `` zscore `` from `` scipy.stats ``.\n",
    "*   Group `` gapminder_2010 `` by `` 'region' `` and transform the `` ['life','fertility'] `` columns by `` zscore ``.\n",
    "*   Construct a boolean Series of the bitwise `` or `` between `` standardized['life'] &lt; -3 `` and `` standardized['fertility'] &gt; 3 ``.\n",
    "*   Filter `` gapminder_2010 `` using `` .loc[] `` and the `` outliers `` Boolean Series. Save the result as `` gm_outliers ``.\n",
    "*   Print `` gm_outliers ``. This has been done for you, so hit 'Submit Answer' to see the results.\n",

    "Many statistical and machine learning packages cannot determine the best action to take when missing data entries are encountered.Dealing with missing data is natural in pandas (both in using the default behavior and in defining a custom behavior). In Chapter 1, you practiced using the `` .dropna() `` method to drop missing values. Now, you will practice imputing missing values. You can use `` .groupby() `` and `` .transform() `` to fill missing data appropriately foreach group.\n",
    "Your job is to fill in missing `` 'age' `` values for passengers on the Titanic with the median age fromtheir `` 'gender' `` and `` 'pclass' ``. To do this, you'll group by the `` 'sex' `` and `` 'pclass' `` columns and transformeach group with a custom function to call `` .fillna() `` and _impute_ the median value.\n",

    "The Olympic competitions between 1952 and 1988 took place during the height of the Cold War between the United States of America (USA) &amp; the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR). Your goal in this exercise is to aggregate the number of distinct sports in which the USA and the USSR won medals during the Cold War years.\n",

There is an additional filtering stage beforehand in which you reduce the original DataFrame `` medals `` by extracting data from the Cold War period that applies only to the US or to the USSR. The relevant country codes in the DataFrame, which has been pre-loaded as `` medals ``, are `` 'USA' `` &amp; `` 'URS' ``.\n",

    "You may have noticed that the medals are ordered according to a lexicographic (dictionary) ordering: `` Bronze `` &lt; `` Gold `` &lt; `` Silver ``.However, you would prefer an ordering consistent with the Olympic rules: `` Bronze `` &lt; `` Silver `` &lt; `` Gold ``.\n",
    "You can achieve this using `` Categorical `` types. In this final exercise, after redefining the `` 'Medal' `` column of the DataFrame `` medals ``, you will repeat the area plot from the previous exercise to see the new ordering.\n",
