    "### Plotting a histogram of iris data\n",
    "For the exercises in this section, you will use a classic data set collected by botanist Edward Anderson and made famous by Ronald Fisher, one of the most prolific statisticians in history. Anderson carefully measured the anatomical properties of samples of three different species of iris, _Iris setosa_, _Iris versicolor_, and _Iris virginica_. The full data set is [available as part of scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_iris.html). Here, you will work with his measurements of petal length.\n",
    "\n",
    "Plot a histogram of the petal lengths of his 50 samples of _Iris versicolor_ using matplotlib/seaborn's default settings. Recall that to specify the default seaborn style, you can use `` sns.set() ``, where `` sns `` is the alias that `` seaborn `` is imported as.\n",
    "\n",
    "The subset of the data set containing the _Iris versicolor_ petal lengths in units of centimeters (cm) is stored in the NumPy array `` versicolor_petal_length ``.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the video, Justin plotted the histograms by using the `` pandas `` library and indexing the DataFrame to extract the desired column. Here, however, you only need to use the provided NumPy array. Also, Justin assigned his plotting statements (except for `` plt.show() ``) to the dummy variable `` _ ``. This is to prevent unnecessary output from being displayed. It is not required for your solutions to these exercises, however it is good practice to use it. Alternatively, if you are working in an interactive environment such as a Jupyter notebook, you could use a `` ; `` after your plotting statements to achieve the same effect. Justin prefers using `` _ ``. Therefore, you will see it used in the solution code.\n",

    "You just heard that the Poisson distribution is a limit of the Binomial distribution for rare events. This makes sense if you think about the stories. Say we do a Bernoulli trial every minute for an hour, each with a success probability of 0.1. We would do 60 trials, and the number of successes is Binomially distributed, and we would expect to get about 6 successes. This is just like the Poisson story we discussed in the video, where we get on average 6 hits on a website per hour. So, the Poisson distribution with arrival rate equal to \\\\(np\\\\) approximates a Binomial distribution for \\\\(n\\\\) Bernoulli trials with probability \\\\(p\\\\) of success (with \\\\(n\\\\) large and \\\\(p\\\\) small). Importantly, the Poisson distribution is often simpler to work with because it has only one parameter instead of two for the Binomial distribution.\n",
