    "\n",
    "In order to import data into Python, you should first have an idea of what files are in your working directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "IPython, which is running on DataCamp's servers, has a bunch of cool commands, including its **magic commands**. For example, starting a line with `!` gives you complete system shell access. This means that the IPython magic command `! ls` will display the contents of your current directory. Your task is to use the IPython magic command `! ls` to check out the contents of your current directory and answer the following question: which of the following files is in your working directory?\n",

    "### Possible Answers\n",

    "\n",
    "Much of the time you will need to import datasets which have different datatypes in different columns; one column may contain strings and another floats, for example. The function `np.loadtxt()` will freak at this. There is another function, `np.genfromtxt()`, which can handle such structures. If we pass `dtype=None` to it, it will figure out what types each column should be.\n",
    "\n",
    "Import `'titanic.csv'` using the function `np.genfromtxt()` as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "`data = np.genfromtxt('titanic.csv', delimiter=',', names=True, dtype=None)`\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the first argument is the filename, the second specifies the delimiter `,` and the third argument `names` tells us there is a header. Because the `data` are of different types, data is an object called a **structured array**. Because numpy arrays have to contain elements that are all the same type, the structured array solves this by being a 1D array, where each element of the array is a row of the flat file imported. You can test this by checking out the array's shape in the shell by executing `np.shape(data)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Accessing rows and columns of structured arrays is super-intuitive: to get the ith row, merely execute `data[i]` and to get the column with name `'Fare'`, execute `data['Fare']`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Print the entire column with name `Survived` to the shell. What are the last 4 values of this column?\n",

    "### Possible Answers\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `database.db` is not a flat file because relational databases contain structured relationships and flat files do not.\n",

If you want yourfiles to be human readable, you may want to save them as text filesin a clever manner. JSONs, which you will see in a later chapter, areappropriate for Python dictionaries.\n",
